# actions

## `update-slack-workflow-canvas` 

You can use this action (or even the independent image!) to create
and manage a workflow "canvas" in slack. The canvas is a single 
message that is updated through the workflow, generating only a single
notification when the workflow starts.

For more information, see [the docs](update-slack-workflow-canvas/README.md).
